# RECURSION
this is the process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly 

is also called a problem solving problem technique in comp science where complex problems are broken down into smaller versionsof the same complex problems then the solutions are combined to solve the complex problems 

It uses divide and conquer technique 
It can reduce the length of code and make it easier to read 
		
1	Terminates when the base case becomes true	Terminates when the condition is false
2	Used with functions	Used with loops
3	Every recursive call needs extra space in the stack memory	Every iteration does not require any extra space
4	Smaller code size	Larger code size

Properties of recursion
In every step we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller

Rules for recursive functions
1.	There must be a base case/stopping condition
2.	There must be a recursive step.
3.	Each and every recursive step/code must move/progress towards the base case

In OOP the recursive function is called recursive method\

Parts of a recursive function 
1.	Base case/stopping condition
a.	Condition that stops the indefintive recursive calls
2.	Recursive step/call/case
