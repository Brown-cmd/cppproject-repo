# functions

a function is defined aa a group of program statements that perform a specific task when called from some part of the program

# types
1. User deefined functions
2. Pre-defined/built-in functions

pre-defined function is a function that is already defined 

# Format
data type, function, parameters
{ (opening brace)


return(r);    
} (closing brace)

a function may have a return type 
a function has parameters
a function has unique name/identifiers

funtions take a divide-and-conquer approach
they make the program easy to debug and maintain

# VOID functions
void functions do not have a return type
# void format
