# NESTED LOOPS Aug 27 2025

a nested loop is a loop insoide another loop 

## a program that prints mathematical table from 1 to 5

two integers i and j 
j will be a loop inside a loop of i 
for as long as j is less than 6 it will print i x j
j will then be increased by one and i x j printed until the condition(j<6) is invalid 

i, in the outer loop, is then increased by 1
j is then reset to 1 
the condition for the outer looop(i<6) is then tested, if that is true, move into the inner loop 
the process continues as j is increased by 1 in the inner loop and i is increased by 1 in the outer loop
